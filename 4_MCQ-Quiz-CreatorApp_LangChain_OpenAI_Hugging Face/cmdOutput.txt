Abstract
YOLOv7 surpasses all known object detectors in both
speed and accuracy in the range from 5 FPS to 160 FPS
and has the highest accuracy 56.8% AP among all known
real-time object detectors with 30 FPS or higher on GPU
V100. YOLOv7-E6 object detector (56 FPS V100, 55.9%
AP) outperforms both transformer-based detector SWIN-
L Cascade-Mask R-CNN (9.2 FPS A100, 53.9% AP) by
509% in speed and 2% in accuracy, and convolutional-
based detector ConvNeXt-XL Cascade-Mask R-CNN (8.6
FPS A100, 55.2% AP) by 551% in speed and 0.7% AP
in accuracy, as well as YOLOv7 outperforms: YOLOR,
YOLOX, Scaled-YOLOv4, YOLOv5, DETR, Deformable
DETR, DINO-5scale-R50, ViT-Adapter-B and many other
object detectors in speed and accuracy. Moreover, we train
YOLOv7 only on MS COCO dataset from scratch without
using any other datasets or pre-trained weights. Source
code is released in https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.
1. Introduction
Real-time object detection is a very important topic in
computer vision, as it is often a necessary component in
computer vision systems. For example, multi-object track-
ing [94, 93], autonomous driving [40, 18], robotics [35, 58],
medical image analysis [34, 46], etc. The computing de-
vices that execute real-time object detection is usually some
mobile CPU or GPU, as well as various neural processing
units (NPU) developed by major manufacturers. For exam-
ple, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute
stick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU
(Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI
processing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are
all NPUs. Some of the above mentioned edge devices focus
on speeding up different operations such as vanilla convolu-
tion, depth-wise convolution, or MLP operations. In this pa-
per, the real-time object detector we proposed mainly hopes
that it can support both mobile GPU and GPU devices from
the edge to the cloud.
In recent years, the real-time object detector is still de-
veloped for different edge device. For example, the devel-

opment of MCUNet [49, 48] and NanoDet [54] focused on
producing low-power single-chip and improving the infer-
ence speed on edge CPU. As for methods such as YOLOX
[21] and YOLOR [81], they focus on improving the infer-
ence speed of various GPUs. More recently, the develop-
ment of real-time object detector has focused on the de-
sign of efﬁcient architecture. As for real-time object de-
tectors that can be used on CPU [54, 88, 84, 83], their de-
sign is mostly based on MobileNet [28, 66, 27], ShufﬂeNet
[92, 55], or GhostNet [25]. Another mainstream real-time
object detectors are developed for GPU [81, 21, 97], they
mostly use ResNet [26], DarkNet [63], or DLA [87], and
then use the CSPNet [80] strategy to optimize the architec-
ture. The development direction of the proposed methods in
this paper are different from that of the current mainstream
real-time object detectors. In addition to architecture op-
timization, our proposed methods will focus on the opti-
mization of the training process. Our focus will be on some
optimized modules and optimization methods which may
strengthen the training cost for improving the accuracy of
object detection, but without increasing the inference cost.
We call the proposed modules and optimization methods
trainable bag-of-freebies.
